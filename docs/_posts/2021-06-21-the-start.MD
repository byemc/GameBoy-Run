The [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) had... no, sorry, ***has*** a *lot* of games released on it over the years. The newest [released] game Wikipedia has on [its list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_Boy_games) was called *Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Kanji no Tatsujin*, released in Japan on March 30, 2001. (It's actually tied with *Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Keisan no Tatsujin*, same region, same dev and same date. Neither had an EU/US release)
