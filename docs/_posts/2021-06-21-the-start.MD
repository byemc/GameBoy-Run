The [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) had... no, sorry, ***has*** a *lot* of games released on it over the years. The newest [released] game Wikipedia has on [its list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_Boy_games) was called *Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Kanji no Tatsujin*, released in Japan on March 30, 2001. (It's actually tied with *Shikakei Atama o Kore Kusuru: Keisan no Tatsujin*, same region, same dev and same date. Neither had an EU/US release) The first games (*Yakuman*, *Alleyway*, *Baseball* and *Super Mario Land*) were released on April 21, 1989. That's a difference of 11 years, 11 months, 1 week and 2 days! There needs to be *something* we can do to make managing our large game libraries easier!

Ok, this is a really silly idea. But what if *all* the Game Boy games you needed were all on the same cartridge? No, it's not that simple. I want an app store for the Game Boy.
